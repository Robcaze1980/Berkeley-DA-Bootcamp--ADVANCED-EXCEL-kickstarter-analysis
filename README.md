# FUNDRISING CAMPAIGNS: LAUNCH DATE AND GOAL DATA ANALYSIS

## Overview of Project
To make an analysis of data from fundrising campaigns and visualizate the outcome of the analysis.
### Purpose
Based on similar fundraising campaigns outcomes data to analyze the relations between the launch dates and goal accomplished for theater and plays campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the launch date (month) three ranges were detected.
Higher pledged sums: three months had the highest pledged amount for their projects. They were April, September and October. The pledged sum oscillated from 600k to 700k.
Medium pledge sums: May, June, July, August and November had an average pledge sum, ranging from 400k to 580k.
Lower pledged sums: On the months of January, February, March and December the lowest sums were obtained, ranging from 200k to 400k.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The plays campaigns shown the highest failure rate (above 70%) when ranged their goals from 25k to 49k.
The successful campaigns (+50%) were with less 1k, in the range of 20-25k and when more than 50k goal.
Low outcome (-30%) in the fundrising was observed in the ranges from 1k to 20k and the range for 30-35k.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
a) To create a pivot table to generate the "Outcome based on goals" table to make it more interactive.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1- From April to November the best results were obtained, with September with the highest outcome.
2- December had the lowest outcome of all the year, followed by the period of January to March.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
If goal is set below than 1k and above 50k will have the highest outcome in plays campaigns.
1- What are some limitations of this dataset?
2- What are some oth4er possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
3- Outcome based on country location
4- Outcome based on days/weeks the campaign was live.
5-Categories/subcategories with more backers.
Analyze a dataset consisting of 4,000 crowdfunding projects to discover hidden trends.
