# Module 4 | Assignment - PyCitySchools

Use Python and the Pandas library to analyze school district data and showcase trends in school performance.

## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT: SCHOOL DISTRICT ANALYSIS

The school board has a suspicion of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders, this after reviewing some reports from all schools.

The next analysis will be used to validate or not, the above suspicions. The strategy to analyze all data collected is to exclude the math and reading scores for Thomas High School, while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once this specific data is isolated, we will run another school district analysis to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
