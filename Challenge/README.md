# Module 4 | Assignment - PyCitySchools

Use Python and the Pandas library to analyze school district data and showcase trends in school performance.

## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT: SCHOOL DISTRICT ANALYSIS

The school board has a suspicion of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders, this after reviewing some reports from all schools.

The next analysis will be used to validate or not, the above suspicions. The strategy to analyze all data collected is to exclude the math and reading scores for Thomas High School, while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once this specific data is isolated, we will run another school district analysis to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## RESULTS

•	How is district summary affected?

After isolating the 461 reading and math grades for 9th grades in Thomas High School (replacing grades wiht NaN values) we starting analizing grades data for 15 schools and 38,709 students in the school district.

The next table, shows a summary for this data (average grades, percentage of students passing both classes and overall passing rate) for all schools in math and reading:

In general, and including THS 9th grade students, the math and reading average grade is 80.4% (78.9% and 81.9% respectively), but the percentage of passing (+70 points) is higher for reading, compared to math, with a difference of 10% (74.8% vs. 85.5%). This result cannot be attributed to the isolation or NaN values, as NaN values are equal and present in both scores and represent +1% of the total scores in the district.

•	How is the school summary affected?


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
